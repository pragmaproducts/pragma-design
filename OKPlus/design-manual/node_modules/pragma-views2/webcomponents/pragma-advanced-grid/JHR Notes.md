#Advanced visualizations

There are a number of parts to this, but the important parts are:

1. the component for the visualization
1. the renderers

There are two main renderers:

1. render-flatlist
1. render-hierarchical

These are fully featured for rendering and should be moved out of the advanced grid for better reuse.


## Flat list renderer
This can be used to render any visualization given a template.
Other visualizations should inherit from this one.

## Hierarcical renderer
This inherits from the flat list renderer so that it can use the flat list logic of leaf nodes, but adds to that group rendering.
This renderer is currently used by the grid but can easily be used by tree views also.

## Notes on list and column view
In the case of the grid and tree views you want to show the group one below the other and indented.
This is not true when it comes to the list and column views. There you want to show one group at a time. Double clicking on the group drills you down to the next level.

In the case of the list and column view you may also have groups and leaf nodes on the same level.
You cant' use the hierarchical renderer as is but you can create a new renderer that works very much the same.

## Tree view
Though the tree view is easy enough from the group node perspective the only complexity it has is that you need to be able to have a template per item type that is renderd.
For example: an asset looks like this and a component looks like that.
The inflators will have to be tailored per type also because the fields and the structures will be diferent.

## Data store
The data store updates the items you have to render from. It adds and removes properties to the objects in the managed array for inflation purposes.
Things like selection should be markers on the object so that when that item gets rendered, it will display right.
Please note that what ever is set must also be cleared from the element when returing to store so that you don't get odd atifacts when reusint the item again.

## Things we need to do

These are the things we still need to do on the gird.

1. keyboard navigation
1. asscessiblity  
1. selection

please note that selection should be passed to the data store and from there make it's way to the datasource.
