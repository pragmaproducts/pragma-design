## Data Management

Data is defined by class **GridItem**.  
Two types of GridItems:  
1. Group        
2. Row

### Group
What is the count.  
Expanding the column adds children to the array.  
Collapsing the column removes children from array.

## Rendering

1. Infinate scroll
1. Dom recycle / Virtualization
1. Tomb stone?

Q: How do we deal with conditional rendering of row colors while scrolling and recycling items.
A: Don't execute conditional rendering during scroll.
A: Calculate values and store it for later.

## Recycle

1. State management (ready - clean / in use).

Q: How to efficiently change between states.

## Kenetic scolling

## Row Color Formula

isActive == false -> color: ui-color-3
siteCode == "A11" -> background: green;

Q: How do I paint this efficiently during scrolling
A: If scroll speed is slow then paint, but if scroll speed is fast, don't

NOTE: Recycle manager needs to know what changes were made so that it can restore default.

## Value converters
Before values are added to the grid ensure that the value converters are used.
