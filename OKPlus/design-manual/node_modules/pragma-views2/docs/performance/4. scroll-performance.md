# Scroll Performance
When scrolling items we need to ensure that things are fast.  
Do not optimise if not required. Generally speaking anthing less than 500 rows does not need any special optimization.

## Common optimizations
1. Scroll the parent not the items.  
Assuming you have a container that has overflow, have that container container another container that sizes according to children.  
Scroll the container with children instead of the children itself. 
1. Use simple styles, classes over complex selectors.
2. When applying changes in CSS ensure you have will-change set to that css property that is changing.
3. Use transform to set positioning, NOT any other positioning property.

## Special optimizations
1. Infiniate scroll is not an option - you can't use scrollbars (mouse drag) and don't know how far from the bottom you are. 
1. Virtualize large collections. Only render what you can show.
