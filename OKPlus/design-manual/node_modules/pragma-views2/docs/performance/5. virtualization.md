# Virtualization

On web when you have to virtualize collections the UI has three main parts.

1. Parent Container
1. Scroll Container
1. Items Container

## Parent Container
This provides the base structure and size.
In virtualized implementations you need to know the width and height you are working on as you need to calculate how many items you can show.

## Scroll Container
This container has only one item and this item is absolutly position.
The child position is calculated according to the number of items in the collection * the height of the items.
This will set the scrollbar height and allow you the full scroll functionality.
It is important that this container has no background of styling beyond it's size.
The container location is set as abosolute with top, left, right and bottom being 0.
Always add will-change: transform to this container as it will affect scrolling performance.

## Items Container
This container contains all the items you scroll. This container does not overflow and the size does not have to be set.
This is the item you will move up and down on the scroll event and should be moved using transform: translate();
Remember to add the will-change property to the CSS.

## Common principles
Virtualized collections render what you can see plus a small top and bottom margin.
When items move outside the frustrom defined by the top and bottom margin, they should be removed from the DOM.

Recycle items you are no longer using instead of creating new ones each time.
Use inflation functions on a predefined structure.
