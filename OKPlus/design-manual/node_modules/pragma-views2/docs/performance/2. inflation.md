#Inflation
Inflation is the process of injecting values into the DOM.  

Inflation optimization is not so much about just adding the values, but re-evaluating the DOM structure each time. 

This is part of binding and it's performance implications depends on how many items you render.
When you are inflating a single item it's ok to process the template and apply the values. If however you are inflating several items you are better served
by creating a inflation function that will inflate elements directly.

See inflation-utils.js for more details.

The basic principal is this. Process a UI element for inflation once. if you only use it once, that is fine. 
The moment you need to inflate more than one use a inflation function geared to that spesific structure.
