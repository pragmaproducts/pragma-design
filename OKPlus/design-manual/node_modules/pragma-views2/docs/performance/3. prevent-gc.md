# Prevent GC
In any garbage collection based system, be it C# or web GC is a expensive operation.
Object stores are common ways to prevent GC. Object stores allow you to recycle items instead of creating new instances every time.

This strategy is only used in cases where you have a recuring collection of items that have a finite life span.
Sprite systems is a example of this where you have data around sprice location and life span. Another example of this is scrollable items in virtualization.

When you are done with an item, return it to the store in order to use again. When you need a item ask it from the store instead of creating a new one.

## GC you can't revent
When performing a requeset animation frame, you will experience GC in virtualization.
Though we want to prevent GC we have no control over this and should thus not worry about it.
If you need to, use a object store to recycle items but don't worry about GC you can't prevent.

## Do not do
Never request any system to perform a GC on your behalf.
