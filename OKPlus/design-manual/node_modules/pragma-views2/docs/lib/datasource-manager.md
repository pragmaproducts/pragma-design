# Data Source Manager

This document describes the required features for the datasource-manager.

## Purpose

Manage keys for data sources, mediates data source primary action call backs and success call backs. 

## Constructing Unique Keys

When a data source is instantiated a call to the Data Source Manager is made to get a unique identifier, with the data
source instance passed as a parameter. Response Type is set by overriding the fetchResponseType method. 

When a data source is disposed, the data source instance key will be passed to the manager for removal.

A numeric counter to create a unique key. Keys will be stored in a map object that sits on the window
as a global variable. The counter will be stored as the key and the data source definition properties:

* data source instance
* response type

## Mediating Callbacks

Callbacks will be mediated by the data source manager. Using the data source response type or the data source definition
properties - remote, action and customizationId - these properties will be used to fetch the response type. The
manager will determine the relevant data source/s action handlers to call.

The relevant parameters will be need to be passed on relevant data source action handler.

## Instantiation

Data source manager will have a single instance sitting on the index.js.
