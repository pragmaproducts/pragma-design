# Schema Structure 

## Sections

### Variables
The variables section contains schema variables which may be accessed anywhere in the schema using the @ operator.  
The variables section usually contains a translations element, which contains strings with translations.

#### Example
```json
"variables": {
    "translations": {
        "translated": "Translated Text"
    }
},
"body": {
    "elements": {
        "element": "div",
        "content": "@translated"
    }
}
```
@translated will be swopped for the text "Translated Text"
